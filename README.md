3) Visitors
------------
- In the website, the visitors can see the list of active articles, and when clicking  on them go to  the article's  
view page, where we will have the title and the content.

4) User balance
-----------------
- Users can add money to their balance, for that they click "Add balance" button, and on that page fill in the 
form with CC number, CVC, expiration date, first name and last name, choose the amount that they want to 
add to their account and submit, and we are adding that  amount to their current balance (if successful  â€“  or 
show error message otherwise)
- Users can see their current balance when they are logged in.

5) Cron
--------
- A small shell, to work as a cron job to run regularly, that charges the clients - by taking some amount from 
their balance. It should simply decrease each users balance by some amount, as simple as that.
